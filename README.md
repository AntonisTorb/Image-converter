# Image converter
Simple Python script that converts between image formats. This should be able to convert between all image formats that are supported by Pillow, but I have only tested `webp`, `jpg` and `png`.

## How to use:
- If it is not already installed in your system, install Pillow with the command `pip install Pillow` , or from the `requirements.txt` file with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` .
- Place all the images you want to convert in the same directory as the `main.py` file.
- Specify the input and output formats of the images at the top of the `main.py` script.
- Execute the script with the command `python main.py`.
- The resulting images should be generated in the `output` folder.

## Thank you and enjoy!
